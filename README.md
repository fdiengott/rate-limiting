# rate-limiting

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run limit
```

or

```bash
bun run slowdown
```

This is just a quick project to implement off the shelf rate limiting since I've never done it before and had thought about it a lot if I decided to build a project that used AI that I was afraid could get expensive (if I went with a proprietary model of course).

This project simply mirrors [this blog](https://blog.appsignal.com/2024/04/03/how-to-implement-rate-limiting-in-express-for-nodejs.html), but with bun for increased install and run speeds.
